To Future Employers:
- This site was built very quickly on a plane while I flew back from vacation as a surprise for my roommate for her birthday.  The code quality here is terrible.  If I wasn't just trying to make things work as quickly as possible, I would never write code like this.  Someday I'll come back and fix this.
